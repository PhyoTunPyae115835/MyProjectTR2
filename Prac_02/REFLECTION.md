# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

70%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch them at home in the evenings, around 7–9pm, after dinner. If the week is busy, I try to catch up on weekends at the library.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been keeping up with practicals each week and committing my code to GitHub as required. I’m also trying to stick to good naming and commenting practices in my code.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Sometimes I rush through the lectures and miss small details, so I want to slow down and take notes instead of skipping ahead.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I tend to leave some tasks unfinished during practicals, thinking I’ll come back to them later, but I often forget. I also rush through without fully understanding everything.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I follow the structure and requirements properly, and I’ve been improving on breaking down problems into smaller parts. I also test my code thoroughly before moving on.
